# Linear Algebra for Computing

This repository contains my solutions for an introductory course in Linear Algebra. It teaches the mathematical foundations of Linear Algebra so as to illustrate their relevance to computer science and applications. It prepares the students for advanced numerical methods in computing, especially in machine learning and data analytics.

#### Course Outline :
- The concept of linearity as it applies to expressions, functions and transformations.
- The notion of vectors and matrices, their operations.
- Important characteristics of matrices, such as its four fundamental subspaces, rank, determinant, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, different factorizations, etc.
- How to use the characteristics of a matrix to solve a linear system of equations or to study
the properties of linear transformations using various algorithms such as Gaussian and Gauss-Jordan
eliminations.
- Important concepts of vector spaces such as independence, basis, dimensions, orthogonality,
Gram-Schmidt process for orthonormalization, etc.
- Properties of special categories of matrices such as symmetric, positive definite, etc.
- Eigenvalue, singular value and other decompositions and their applications.
- Several algorithms in and using Linear Algebra, like linear regression, QR and power iteration for
eigen-analysis, Cholesky decomposition etc.
